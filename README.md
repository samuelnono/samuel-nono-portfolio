Samuel Nono – Data Systems & Applied AI Portfolio



About

I design data systems that move from raw input to structured insight.
My work spans ETL pipelines, distributed databases, analytics engineering, and applied AI systems; especially where data, behavior, and technology cross paths.
With a background in psychology and business, I’m drawn to building systems that are technically sound and human-aware.
This portfolio highlights the projects where I’ve translated architecture, modeling, and machine learning into practical systems.






Data Systems & Engineering

1. Sakila Data Warehouse (ETL + OLAP Modeling)

Tools: MySQL, SQL, Snowflake Schema, BI Dashboards
  
    Migrated a normalized OLTP schema into a snowflake-style analytical warehouse. Designed fact and dimension tables, simulated batch data loads, and developed aggregate queries to support business KPIs.

Key Focus:
  
    OLTP → OLAP transformation
  
    Fact table modeling
  
    Referential integrity validation
  
    KPI query optimization

2. Celsius – Distributed MongoDB Cloud System

Tools: MongoDB, SQL, Multi-VM Architecture, Stored Procedures
  
      Designed and deployed a multi-region MongoDB architecture simulating global operations (Japan, U.S., Argentina). Implemented validation rules, aggregation pipelines, financial modeling logic, and explain plans.

Key Focus:
  
    Distributed database design
  
    Schema validation and constraints
  
    Aggregation pipelines
  
    Business logic enforcement

3. Forkast – Containerized Data Pipeline

Tools: React, Flask, MongoDB, Docker 
        
        Built a full-stack containerized application focused on structured data ingestion, API validation, and analytics-ready storage.

Key Focus:
    
    REST API testing
    
    JSON ingestion
    
    Schema inspection
    
    Docker-based deployment

4. Auralis – Emotion-Aware Music Recommendation System

Tools: Python, Feature Engineering, ML, Streamlit
  
        Developing a frequency- and emotion-aware music recommendation system combining acoustic feature extraction with interpretable emotion mapping.

Key Focus:
  
    Feature extraction (MFCCs)
  
    Emotion modeling
  
    Similarity-based recommendation
  
    Human-centered AI design

5. Emotion Recognition & Retrieval Systems

Tools: CNNs, RNN/LSTM, Transformers, FAISS, LoRA, Flan-T5
  
      Projects exploring facial emotion recognition, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and multimodal intelligence systems.

Key Focus:
    
    CNN-based classification
    
    Vector search
   
    LLM fine-tuning concepts
      
    Hybrid intelligence research
